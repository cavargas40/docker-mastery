# What is Kubernetes? - The origins of Google's orchestrator

- Kubernetes = popular container orchestrator.
- Container Orchestration = Make many servers act like one.
- Released by Google in 2015, maintained by large community.
- Runs on top of Docker (usually) as a set of APIs in containers
- Provides API/CLI to manage containers across servers
- Many clouds provide it for you
- Many vendors make a "distribution" of it

# Why Kubernetes?

- Review "Swarm Mode: built-in orchestration"
- Orchestration: Next logical step in journey to faster DevOps
- First, understand why you *may* need orchestration
- Not every solution needs orchestration
- Servers + Change Rate = Benefit of orchestration
- Then, decide which orchestrator
- If Kubernetes, decide which distribution
  - cloud or self-managed (Docker Enterprise, Rancher, OpenShift, Canonical, VMWare PKS)
- Don't usually need pure upstream

ECS AWS = Orchestration

# Kubernetes or Swarm?
- Review "Swarm Mode: Built-In Orchestration"
- Kubernetes and Swarm are both container orchestrators
- Both are solid platforms with vendor backing
- Swarm: Easier to deploy / manage
- Kubernetes: More features and flexibility
- What's right for you? Understand both and know your requirements?

## Advantages of Swarm

- Comes with Docker, single vendor container platform
- Easiest orchestrator to deploy/manage yourself
- Follows 80/20, 20% of features for 80% of use cases
- Runs anywhere Docker does:
  - local, cloud, datacenter
  - ARM, windows, 32-bit
- Secure by default
- Easier to troubleshoot

## Advantages of Kubernetes

- Clouds will deploy/manage Kubernetes for you
- Infrastructure vendors are making their own distributions
- Widest adoption and community
- Flexible: Covers widest set of use cases
- "Kubernetes first" vendor support
- "No on ever got fired for buying IBM"
  - Picking solutions isn't 100% rational
  - Trendly, will benefit your career
  - CIO/CTO Checkbox
