# Docker Compose

-Why: configure relationships between containers
-Why: save our docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
-Why: create one-liner developer environment startups
-Comprised of 2 separate but related things
    1. YAML-formatted file that describes our solution options for:
        -containers
        -networks
        -volumes
    2. A CLI tool docker-compose used for local dev/test automation with those YAML files.

docker-compose.yml
-Compose YAML format has it's own versions: 1, 2, 2.1, 3, 3.1
-YAML file can be used with docker-compose command for local docker automation or...
-with Docker directly in production with Swarm (as of v1.13)
-docker-compose --help
-docker-compose.yml is default filename, but can be used with docker-compose -f

# docker-compose CLI

-CLI tool comes with Docker for Windows / Mac, but separate download for Linux.
-Not a production-grade tool but ideal for local development and test
-Two most common commands are:
   docker compose up
   -setup volumes/networks and start all containers
   docker-compose down
   -stop all containers and remove cont/vol/net

-If all your projects had a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml the "new developer onboarding" would be:
   git clone github.com/some/software
   docker-compose up

compose/sample-2
docker-compose up
docker-compose up -d

docker-compose logs
docker-compose logs | grep "AH00558:"
docker-compose ps
docker-compose down

ASSIGNMENT:
# Writing a compose file

-Build a basic compose file for a Drupal content management system website. Docker hub is your friend
-Use the drupal image along with the postgres image
-Use ports to expose Drupal on 8080 so you can localhost:8080
-Be sure to set POSTGRES_PASSWORD for postgres
-Walk though Drupal setup via browser
-Tip: Drupal assumes DB is localhost, but it's service name
-Extra Credit: Use volumes to store Drupal unique data

compose/assignment

docker-compose up
docker-compose down -v  
-this command delete the volumes...

# Using compose to Build

-Compose can also build your custom images
-Will build them with docker-compose up if not found in cache
-Also rebuild with docker-compose build
-Great for complex builds that have lots of vars or build args

compose/sample-3

docker-compose up
docker-compose down
docker-compose down --rmi local
--remove local images that have been built

ASSIGNMENT:

# Image building with compose - Build and Run Compose

-"Build custom Drupal image for local testing"
-Compose isn't just for developers. Testing apps is easy/fun!
-Maybe your learning Drupal admin, or are a software tester
-Start with compose file from previous assignment
-Make your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml in dir compose/assignment-2
-Use the drupal image along with the postgres image as before
-Use README.md in that dir for details

compose/assignment-2

-after doing
docker-compose up
docker-compose down

-and run again
docker-compose up
-the data keeps intact because of the volumes
